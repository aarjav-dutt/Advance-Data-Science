## Abstract
Credit-card fraud is a growing problem worldwide
which costs billions of dollars per year. Advanced
classification methods provide the ability to detect
fraudulent transactions without disturbance of
legitimate transactions and unnecessarily spent
resources on fraud forensics for financial institutions.
This paper discusses automated credit card fraud
detection by means of machine learning. The aim of
the project is to compare the results obtained by
various classifiers (Logistic regression, Synthetic
Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE),
Random Forest) and also by various deep learning
modeling techniques to achieve the maximum
accuracy to predict fraudulent credit card
transactions. Weâ€™ll be trying to scale and resample
the imbalance dataset and find the best algorithms
that identifies the unusual patterns that do not
conform to expected behavior. One way to achieve
this is by oversampling, which is adding copies of the
under-represented class (better when you have little
data). Another is UNDER-sampling, which deletes
instances from the over-represented class (better
when he have lots of data) We would be using
various different additional features such as feature
selection, under-over sampling of data,
supervised-unsupervised modeling, scaling etc and
note the accuracy.
